#  Bugs
This document will detail any bugs that I have found during the development of Liber. 

## Existing Bugs
    * BUG REPORT 001 - Due to the app searching the database asynchornously, the bookcase only loads once the Table is refreshed. I have attempted to work on it for a couple of hours but no avail, so will move on and come back to it later. 
    * BUG REPORT 002 - When a barcode is scanned, the ConfirmEntryController opens twice.
